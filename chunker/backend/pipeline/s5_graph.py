S5 — Entity Intelligence & Graph Enrichment
=============================================
Pipeline position : runs AFTER S4 (boundary quality filter) and BEFORE S6 (embedding).
Responsibility    : extract named entities from each chunk, build a typed-edge
                    knowledge graph linking chunks that share entities, enrich
                    each chunk's embedding with its graph neighbourhood, and
                    persist entity co-occurrences to the KG store for warm-start
                    on future document runs.

Architecture overview
─────────────────────
1. NER extraction  — spaCy (en_core_web_sm) or regex fallback.
2. Entity linking  — canonical form + head token for coreference grouping.
3. Relation extraction — lightweight subject–verb–object pattern matching.
4. Graph construction  — chunks are NODES; edges connect chunks that share
                         entities or relations, weighted by co-occurrence count.
   Three edge types:
     shared_entity  — both chunks mention the same canonical entity
     relation_bridge — both chunks mention the same (subject, object) pair
     kg_prior       — entity pair has historical co-occurrence in KGStore

5. GNN-style enrichment — each chunk's graph_vector is the weighted mean
   embedding of its graph neighbours (message-passing step):
       h_graph(Cᵢ) = Σⱼ∈N(i) (wᵢⱼ / Σwᵢⱼ) · e(Cⱼ)
   This lets a chunk "borrow" information from topically related chunks
   even if they are far apart in the document.

6. KGStore write — new entity co-occurrences are persisted to disk so that
   the next document run benefits from accumulated prior knowledge.

Known limitation — NER model
─────────────────────────────
The default spaCy model (en_core_web_sm) was trained on English newswire.
For French legal/financial documents (Tunisian regulations, tax conventions)
it will mislabel generic French phrases as PERSON/DATE/ORG.
Recommended fix: install fr_core_news_sm and auto-detect language in _get_nlp().
Until then, the _link_entities() canonical form at least deduplicates surface
variants, and the KGStore accumulates useful signal across multiple runs.

    Stores entity co-occurrence counts across ALL pipeline runs.
    S5 reads prior edge weights BEFORE building the current document's graph,

    This means:
    - First run on document A: KGStore is empty; graph built from doc A only.

    Matches Capitalised multi-word phrases (1–5 words) as generic ENTITYs.

    The key problem with the original: in French (and most Romance languages),
    ALL sentence-starters are capitalised, so naive Capitalised-phrase matching
    produces enormous noise ("Sont", "Personnes", "Etat", "Lorsque", …).

    Fix: we apply three filters before accepting an entity:
      1. Minimum length: the phrase must be > 3 characters.
      2. Blocklist: a union of English AND French common sentence-starters
         and grammatical words that are never true named entities.
      3. Position filter: if the match starts exactly at a sentence boundary
         (preceded by ". " or newline), it is likely a sentence-starter
         capitalised by grammar — skip it.

    Returns up to 30 unique entities labelled "ENTITY".
